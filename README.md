# Standard

**A modular Python utility library with predictable behavior and agent-first guidance.**

The project and PyPI distribution are named `standard`; the Python import package and command are named `std`. Install core by itself or add FastAPI, AWS, HTTP, Redis cache, or relational database support through an extra. All six distributions share one release version; see the [publishing guide](docs/publishing.md) for the current release. Standard is an alpha library; the [documentation site](https://appunni-m.github.io/python-standard/) has the guides, API contracts, examples, and release instructions.

## Install from PyPI

```bash
python -m pip install standard
python -m pip install 'standard[fastapi]'
python -m pip install 'standard[aws]'
python -m pip install 'standard[http]'
python -m pip install 'standard[cache]'
python -m pip install 'standard[rdbms]'
python -m pip install 'standard[fastapi,aws,http,cache,rdbms]'
```

The core provides YAML/TOML configuration, Pydantic Settings sources, immutable snapshots, recursive mapping helpers, atomic text writes, environment-aware logging, async service lifecycle management, and the `std` CLI. FastAPI, AWS, HTTP, cache, and RDBMS are separately installable distributions. The `standard[fastapi]`, `standard[aws]`, `standard[http]`, `standard[cache]`, and `standard[rdbms]` extras select those providers. All six distributions share the same release version; see the [publishing guide](docs/publishing.md) for the current status and tag workflow.

## Install from this checkout

Run these commands from the repository root. The integration source projects are installed alongside core in editable mode.

| Need | Command | Import path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core only | `python -m pip install -e .` | `std` |
| FastAPI | `python -m pip install -e . -e packages/standard-fastapi` | `std.fastapi` |
| AWS | `python -m pip install -e . -e packages/standard-aws` | `std.aws` |
| HTTP | `python -m pip install -e . -e packages/standard-http` | `std.http` |
| Redis cache | `python -m pip install -e . -e packages/standard-cache` | `std.cache` |
| Relational databases | `python -m pip install -e . -e packages/standard-rdbms` | `std.rdbms` |
| All providers | `python -m pip install -e . -e packages/standard-fastapi -e packages/standard-aws -e packages/standard-http -e packages/standard-cache -e packages/standard-rdbms` | All provider modules |

The editable installs above are for developing this checkout. For an application, install the released package and only the integration extras it uses; core does not import or install optional providers by default.

## First use

Create `config/settings.yaml`:

```yaml
database:
  host: localhost
```

Then load a value from it:

```python
from std.config import ConfigManager

config = ConfigManager.from_file("config/settings.yaml")
host = config.snapshot.get_path("database.host", "localhost")
```

For Pydantic Settings, create `config/app.yaml`:

```yaml
host: localhost
port: 8080
```

Define a Pydantic Settings model in `core/settings.py`:

```python
from std.config import YamlSettings


class Settings(YamlSettings):
    std_config_file = "config/app.yaml"
    host: str
    port: int = 8080
```

In `main.py`, construct the model once and use it to build the application:

```python
from app.core.settings import Settings


def main() -> None:
    settings = Settings()
    # Build the application and inject its validated settings here.


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Call `Settings()` only from the application entry point. By default, Pydantic Settings resolves values in this order: constructor values, Standard config files, process environment, dotenv, and file secrets. Callers can change the order through Pydantic's `settings_customise_sources` hook.

## Agent guidance

```bash
std guide
std guide --format json
std skill show
std skill install
```

`std guide` summarizes the supported library surface for coding agents. `std guide --format json` emits schema-versioned install, module, command, and documentation data. `std skill show` prints the packaged idiomatic-Python skill. `std skill install` writes it to `.agents/skills/standard-idiomatic-python/SKILL.md` and refuses to overwrite an existing file unless you pass `--force`.

The source repository contains the development checks, end-to-end tests, and full documentation site. The published distribution is intended to contain only the working library, its CLI, and the required package metadata, README, and license.
